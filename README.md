 Turbine is a e-commerce website designed to streamline the buying and selling of bike and car
 spare parts. The platform offers a seamless experience for users to register, log in, and manage
 their profiles, where they can view personal details, order history, and cart items. Users can browse
 various spare parts, add them to their cart, and proceed to checkout with options like Cash on
 Delivery or online payment. Additionally, users can provide feedback and reviews for the products
 they purchase, enhancing community trust and product quality insights.
 The system also includes a dedicated company login where vendors can list new spare parts,
 update existing stock, and manage inventory efficiently. An admin panel provides centralized
 monitoring of users, companies, products, feedback, and overall platform activity. By integrating
 essential e-commerce functionalities with clear role-based access, Turbine creates a reliable and
 user-friendly environment for both customers and spare part providers, contributing to a more
 organized and digitalized auto parts marketplace.
